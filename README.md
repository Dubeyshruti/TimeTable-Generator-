# Timetable-Management-System
This project is a part of the Final Project submission for Software Tools Laboratory(PCCCS492)
Key Components:

Tkinter:
Graphical User Interface (GUI) framework for Python.
Creates windows, buttons, labels, input fields, and other interactive elements.
Python:
Programming language for logic, calculations, and database interactions.
Handles user input, data processing, and timetable generation.
Database:
Stores course information, student details, teacher availability, and other relevant data.
SQLite (built-in with Python) or external databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL can be used.
General Workflow:

Database Setup:
Create tables to store course details, resources, constraints, etc.
Establish a connection between Python and the database.
GUI Design (Tkinter):
Build a user-friendly interface with elements for:
Input (courses, teachers, time slots, constraints)
Displaying the generated timetable
User interaction (buttons for generating, saving, exporting)
Data Handling (Python):
Retrieve user input from GUI elements.
Fetch relevant data from the database.
Implement a scheduling algorithm to generate the timetable, considering constraints and preferences.
Timetable Creation:
Construct the timetable using Python data structures (lists, dictionaries).
Apply formatting and visual elements for clarity.
Timetable Display:
Present the generated timetable within the Tkinter interface.
Additional Features (Optional):
Saving timetables to different formats (PDF, Excel, CSV).
Importing/exporting data from/to external sources.
User authentication and access control.
Database Interaction:
Store generated timetables in the database for future reference.
Allow modifications and updates to existing data.
